Good tv in the price range with most of the features and screen size. Only if they could have added airplay support in this it would have been even more smart.

I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17. So if you are watching some good Hollywood movie you always have to keep the remote in your hand. But you can always enhance it with a sound bar but remember it will increase your TV price overall. So sound quality - 2/53. Software experience -  It's an android based TV. I found it very good, user friendly and there was no lag at all. I can't say much on this since I do not have hands on experience with say Samsung or Sony TV UI. Remember all above points regarding software experience are only valid as long as you have good internet connection. I would say minimum internet speed of 2 MBps / 16 Mbps is required. One feature I found very useful is google voice assistance, so instead of using tedious and prolonged virtual keyboard voice recognition is very handy feature. I haven't played any games on it and I don't know if I ever will, so can't say anything on it. So software experience - 4/54. Build quality - I found it to be good. The back panel is made of plastic but now a days even branded TVs make plastic back panel. My TV is wall mount so I don't think it's gonna break anytime soon unless done intentionally. But maybe table mount users will find some issue since it is very light weighted TV. So build quality - 3/55. Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5. I am writing this review after using it a month only and till now no problem at all, so I don't know how their warranty services will be? But based on the reviews I read online lets give them - 3/5. So overall - 4/5Overall Score - 3.6/5Conclusion - If you are not super rich and expecting a life time of TV to be 4-6 years then this TV is a worth and a very good buy (just need an extra sound bar to enhance sound quality). Now you must be expecting the life of TV to be more than this. Okay, lets say even most of these TV will last longer than 6 years and will be working perfectly fine then also they will become outdated since year on year new display technologies are coming and features are increasing drastically. For reference take life cycle of a mobile phone now and a decade before. Overall you will not regret buying this TV if you are tight on budget.

 I am writing this review after one week of use and found it worth of money because of following reasons1.Display quality is really good, you can play 4K videos on this, even full HD 1080p looks really good2.Down firing speakers sounds good and loud3.Pathwall has some free TV channels available like ABP Zee News 9XM ( need to explore more)4. Bluetooth remote makes it easy to control the TV as you don’t need to point it towards the TV5. Farfield mic works well but when TV is loud you also need to shout loudThe TV has some down sides as well1. Mi home app is useless as it just switch on-off the TV, remote features are not available yet2.You can connect with Alexa but it just controls volume and switch off, doesn’t do anything else3. Only one switch available in tv to on-off, no volume control switches4. Remote could have charging option instead of cells5. Mi is still not providing wall mount with tv, need to purchase separately6. Remote could have dedicated mute button instead of double clicking volume down key

I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17. So if you are watching some good Hollywood movie you always have to keep the remote in your hand. But you can always enhance it with a sound bar but remember it will increase your TV price overall. So sound quality - 2/53. Software experience -  It's an android based TV. I found it very good, user friendly and there was no lag at all. I can't say much on this since I do not have hands on experience with say Samsung or Sony TV UI. Remember all above points regarding software experience are only valid as long as you have good internet connection. I would say minimum internet speed of 2 MBps / 16 Mbps is required. One feature I found very useful is google voice assistance, so instead of using tedious and prolonged virtual keyboard voice recognition is very handy feature. I haven't played any games on it and I don't know if I ever will, so can't say anything on it. So software experience - 4/54. Build quality - I found it to be good. The back panel is made of plastic but now a days even branded TVs make plastic back panel. My TV is wall mount so I don't think it's gonna break anytime soon unless done intentionally. But maybe table mount users will find some issue since it is very light weighted TV. So build quality - 3/55. Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5. I am writing this review after using it a month only and till now no problem at all, so I don't know how their warranty services will be? But based on the reviews I read online lets give them - 3/5. So overall - 4/5Overall Score - 3.6/5Conclusion - If you are not super rich and expecting a life time of TV to be 4-6 years then this TV is a worth and a very good buy (just need an extra sound bar to enhance sound quality). Now you must be expecting the life of TV to be more than this. Okay, lets say even most of these TV will last longer than 6 years and will be working perfectly fine then also they will become outdated since year on year new display technologies are coming and features are increasing drastically. For reference take life cycle of a mobile phone now and a decade before. Overall you will not regret buying this TV if you are tight on budget.

I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17.

 I am writing this review after one week of use and found it worth of money because of following reasons1.Display quality is really good, you can play 4K videos on this, even full HD 1080p looks really good2.Down firing speakers sounds good and loud3.Pathwall has some free TV channels available like ABP Zee News 9XM ( need to explore more)4. Bluetooth remote makes it easy to control the TV as you don’t need to point it towards the TV5. Farfield mic works well but when TV is loud you also need to shout loudThe TV has some down sides as well1. Mi home app is useless as it just switch on-off the TV, remote features are not available yet2.You can connect with Alexa but it just controls volume and switch off, doesn’t do anything else3. Only one switch available in tv to on-off, no volume control switches4. Remote could have charging option instead of cells5. Mi is still not providing wall mount with tv, need to purchase separately6. Remote could have dedicated mute button instead of double clicking volume down key

I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17. So if you are watching some good Hollywood movie you always have to keep the remote in your hand. But you can always enhance it with a sound bar but remember it will increase your TV price overall. So sound quality - 2/53. Software experience -  It's an android based TV. I found it very good, user friendly and there was no lag at all. I can't say much on this since I do not have hands on experience with say Samsung or Sony TV UI. Remember all above points regarding software experience are only valid as long as you have good internet connection. I would say minimum internet speed of 2 MBps / 16 Mbps is required. One feature I found very useful is google voice assistance, so instead of using tedious and prolonged virtual keyboard voice recognition is very handy feature. I haven't played any games on it and I don't know if I ever will, so can't say anything on it. So software experience - 4/54. Build quality - I found it to be good. The back panel is made of plastic but now a days even branded TVs make plastic back panel. My TV is wall mount so I don't think it's gonna break anytime soon unless done intentionally. But maybe table mount users will find some issue since it is very light weighted TV. So build quality - 3/55. Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5. I am writing this review after using it a month only and till now no problem at all, so I don't know how their warranty services will be? But based on the reviews I read online lets give them - 3/5. So overall - 4/5Overall Score - 3.6/5Conclusion - If you are not super rich and expecting a life time of TV to be 4-6 years then this TV is a worth and a very good buy (just need an extra sound bar to enhance sound quality). Now you must be expecting the life of TV to be more than this. Okay, lets say even most of these TV will last longer than 6 years and will be working perfectly fine then also they will become outdated since year on year new display technologies are coming and features are increasing drastically. For reference take life cycle of a mobile phone now and a decade before. Overall you will not regret buying this TV if you are tight on budget.

I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17. So if you are watching some good Hollywood movie you always have to keep the remote in your hand. But you can always enhance it with a sound bar but remember it will increase your TV price overall. So sound quality - 2/53. Software experience -  It's an android based TV. I found it very good, user friendly and there was no lag at all. I can't say much on this since I do not have hands on experience with say Samsung or Sony TV UI. Remember all above points regarding software experience are only valid as long as you have good internet connection. I would say minimum internet speed of 2 MBps / 16 Mbps is required. One feature I found very useful is google voice assistance, so instead of using tedious and prolonged virtual keyboard voice recognition is very handy feature. I haven't played any games on it and I don't know if I ever will, so can't say anything on it. So software experience - 4/54. Build quality - I found it to be good. The back panel is made of plastic but now a days even branded TVs make plastic back panel. My TV is wall mount so I don't think it's gonna break anytime soon unless done intentionally. But maybe table mount users will find some issue since it is very light weighted TV. So build quality - 3/55. Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5. I am writing this review after using it a month only and till now no problem at all, so I don't know how their warranty services will be? But based on the reviews I read online lets give them - 3/5. So overall - 4/5Overall Score - 3.6/5Conclusion - If you are not super rich and expecting a life time of TV to be 4-6 years then this TV is a worth and a very good buy (just need an extra sound bar to enhance sound quality). Now you must be expecting the life of TV to be more than this. Okay, lets say even most of these TV will last longer than 6 years and will be working perfectly fine then also they will become outdated since year on year new display technologies are coming and features are increasing drastically. For reference take life cycle of a mobile phone now and a decade before. Overall you will not regret buying this TV if you are tight on budget.


I just purchased this believe me, the outcomes results of it very much appreciated and worthwhile for every aspects. Have a lot of fun with this go ahead.

Picture quality is very good and very easy to operate. Free live tv channels are not present as shown in details so without subscription channels can not be operated. Rest everything is best.

 I am writing this review after one week of use and found it worth of money because of following reasons1.Display quality is really good, you can play 4K videos on this, even full HD 1080p looks really good2.Down firing speakers sounds good and loud3.Pathwall has some free TV channels available like ABP Zee News 9XM ( need to explore more)4. Bluetooth remote makes it easy to control the TV as you don’t need to point it towards the TV5. Farfield mic works well but when TV is loud you also need to shout loudThe TV has some down sides as well1. Mi home app is useless as it just switch on-off the TV, remote features are not available yet2.You can connect with Alexa but it just controls volume and switch off, doesn’t do anything else3. Only one switch available in tv to on-off, no volume control switches4. Remote could have charging option instead of cells5. Mi is still not providing wall mount with tv, need to purchase separately6. Remote could have dedicated mute button instead of double clicking volume down key

Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5. I am writing this review after using it a month only and till now no problem at all, so I don't know how their warranty services will be? But based on the reviews I read online lets give them - 3/5. So overall - 4/5Overall Score - 3.6/5Conclusion - If you are not super rich and expecting a life time of TV to be 4-6 years then this TV is a worth and a very good buy (just need an extra sound bar to enhance sound quality). Now you must be expecting the life of TV to be more than this. Okay, lets say even most of these TV will last longer than 6 years and will be working perfectly fine then also they will become outdated since year on year new display technologies are coming and features are increasing drastically. For reference take life cycle of a mobile phone now and a decade before. Overall you will not regret buying this TV if you are tight on budget.


I just purchased this believe me, the outcomes results of it very much appreciated and worthwhile for every aspects. Have a lot of fun with this go ahead.


Good one


Good tv in the price range with most of the features and screen size. Only if they could have added airplay support in this it would have been even more smart.


TV screen mey straite lines problem ho tho 2 baar tv exchange kardiya tha , sound quality is very bad poor quality,, time jone change horaha hi, baar baar tv mey time set karna padra ha hi


Performance and easy to use


I will give review on each aspects of a television.Starting with two most important aspects:1. Picture Quality - If you are buying this TV I am assuming that you are not going for some big sizes like 65 or 80 inch. I found the picture quality to be more than good enough for a normal household use. I would even say that you will find the picture quality to be excellent unless you are comparing this TV side by side with Samsung or Sony TV. In short our naked eyes are not capable to find much quality difference unless the picture quality of a TV is very bad. So picture quality - 5/52. Sound quality - Here, I was quite disappointed. The best I could say is the sound quality is average. If you are watching daily Indian shows or may be news or sports then it wont be much of a problem. The problem starts with movies especially Hollywood movies. There is a major balancing problem between background music and dialogues. At times the background music goes very loud and dialogues are very soft, muffled and not clear at all. The TV has volume limits of 0-50, so sometimes to listen dialogues clearly I have to go as high as 40 and to lower the background music I have go as low as 17. So if you are watching some good Hollywood movie you always have to keep the remote in your hand. But you can always enhance it with a sound bar but remember it will increase your TV price overall. So sound quality - 2/53. Software experience -  It's an android based TV. I found it very good, user friendly and there was no lag at all. I can't say much on this since I do not have hands on experience with say Samsung or Sony TV UI. Remember all above points regarding software experience are only valid as long as you have good internet connection. I would say minimum internet speed of 2 MBps / 16 Mbps is required. One feature I found very useful is google voice assistance, so instead of using tedious and prolonged virtual keyboard voice recognition is very handy feature. I haven't played any games on it and I don't know if I ever will, so can't say anything on it. So software experience - 4/54. Build quality - I found it to be good. The back panel is made of plastic but now a days even branded TVs make plastic back panel. My TV is wall mount so I don't think it's gonna break anytime soon unless done intentionally. But maybe table mount users will find some issue since it is very light weighted TV. So build quality - 3/55. Installation and after sale services - Reviews of these services change region by region since MI pan India presence is not very solid. So I can't say abut regions but I will tell you mine. The installation was completed after 6 hours of delivery and also the installer guided me through features. So installation service - 5/5.

Picture quality is very good and very easy to operate. Free live tv channels are not present as shown in details so without subscription channels can not be operated. Rest everything is best.

 I am writing this review after one week of use and found it worth of money because of following reasons1.Display quality is really good, you can play 4K videos on this, even full HD 1080p looks really good2.Down firing speakers sounds good and loud3.Pathwall has some free TV channels available like ABP Zee News 9XM ( need to explore more)4. Bluetooth remote makes it easy to control the TV as you don’t need to point it towards the TV5. Farfield mic works well but when TV is loud you also need to shout loudThe TV has some down sides as well1. Mi home app is useless as it just switch on-off the TV, remote features are not available yet2.You can connect with Alexa but it just controls volume and switch off, doesn’t do anything else3. Only one switch available in tv to on-off, no volume control switches4. Remote could have charging option instead of cells5. Mi is still not providing wall mount with tv, need to purchase separately6. Remote could have dedicated mute button instead of double clicking volume down key
